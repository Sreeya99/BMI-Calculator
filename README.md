# BMI-Calculator
This BMI calculator project is a testament to my journey in learning Python programming. It allowed me to apply fundamental coding concepts and gain hands-on experience in problem-solving. The calculator takes user inputs for name, height, and weight, and computes the Body Mass Index (BMI), providing personalized messages based on the result.

Technologies Used
Python: The project is written in Python, leveraging its simplicity and versatility.
Jupyter Notebook: I utilized Jupyter Notebook for code development, providing an interactive and visually appealing environment.
Key Learnings
Input/Output Functions: I gained proficiency in handling user inputs and displaying calculated outputs.
Conditional Statements: The project involved the use of conditional statements to determine BMI categories.
Unit Conversion: I learned how to convert units, crucial for accurate BMI calculations.
String Formatting: The project enhanced my skills in formatting strings for a cleaner user experience.
Math Module: I explored the math module to perform complex calculations with ease.
Usage
To run the BMI calculator, simply input your name, height, and weight when prompted. The program will then calculate your BMI and provide a personalized message based on the result.
